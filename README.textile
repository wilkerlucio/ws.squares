h1. WebSockets Squares

h2. About

Its a tiny app to make an experiment with WebSockets. It uses Node as application manager, and Sinatra as front server.

h2. Requirements

In order to run this app you need to have installed:

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Node
* CoffeeScript

h2. Install

Just clone the repository.

bc. git clone git://github.com:wilkerlucio/ws.squares.git

h2. Run

You need to run the two servers:

bc. ruby game.rb
coffee ws-server.coffee

Them open some browser windows (prefer Chrome 4+ which supports websockets natively) and access:

bc. http://localhost:4567

Use the keyboard arrows to move your square, when you move, your square position will be automatically updated on other screens at real time :)

h2. Misc

For purists, I exported a js version of ws-server. You can run this without coffee.
